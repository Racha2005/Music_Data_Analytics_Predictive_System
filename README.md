Displays the most popular tracks with details such as:
- Track ID  
- Title  
- Genre  
- Popularity score  

Helps users quickly browse top-performing songs.

#### **Genre Distribution Chart**
A professional-style bar chart embedded into the Tkinter window using Matplotlib.  
Shows the distribution of tracks across different genres.

#### **Recommendation Popup Window**
When a track is selected, the system:
1. Evaluates similarity based on numerical features  
2. Displays top recommended tracks in a popup  
3. Shows title, genre, and popularity score  

The desktop interface is intentionally lightweight and user-friendly.

#### **Dark Neon Aesthetic**
Both UI frames and components use:
- Dark backgrounds  
- Cyan text  
- Modern dashboard-style styling  



### **3. Machine Learning Components**

This project includes machine-learning scripts integrated to enhance functionality.

#### **Popularity Prediction**
Model: RandomForestRegressor  
Purpose:
- Predict whether a song is likely to be popular  
- Helps in analytics or playlist ranking  

#### **Mood Classification**
Tracks are classified into mood categories using:
- Energy  
- Valence  
- Acousticness  
- Danceability  

Mood categories like:
- Positive  
- Calm / Neutral  
Helps generate playlist suggestions.

#### **Content-Based Recommender**
A key feature of the project.  
Compares songs using:
- Genre match (priority weighted)  
- Popularity proximity  
- Feature similarity:
  - Energy  
  - Valence  
  - Danceability  
  - Acousticness  

Outputs a ranked list of most similar tracks.
